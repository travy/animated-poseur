#  The Animated Poseur
2D Animated Sprite Creator using the Java Run-time Environment for cross-platform support.

## Description
The Animated Poseur was an application that I wrote for my Computer Science 3 course during my Junior year at Stony Brook University.  The project was to create an animated sprite editor where users can house numerouse animation sequences for their characters and control the frame-rate in which the animation would take place in.

## Purpose
During the initial development of the application I had been using SVN since that was the version control system that I used at the time.  Although the project had at one point been finished; the final version has been lost.  I had a SVN server setup that the final version which crashed on me shortly after finishing up at Stony Brook.  Recently I stumbled upon an old backup that I had on an external drive but SVN is not a distributed version control system and therefore the project is not complete.

Over the past 2 years I have worked professionally as a PHP developer and wish to get back up to par with General-Purpose languages such as Java.  For this reason I have decided to continue the project and restore the final version in an open-source community mannor.  Having said such, I have looked through some of the source code and this was definately written back in my college days.  I've decided to house the current version in it's own container dubbed v1.0 and will continue to work on all future development in the v2.0-develop branch.  There is a lot of ground that will need to be covered including writing build task in Gradle, possibly upgrading to JavaFX and Unit Testing (Only heard of Unit Testing in passing in my school days lol)

##  Legacy Version Installation
The original version of the project was developed with Netbeans and does not have a modern build utility such as Gradle or even Ant.  The easiest way to run it is to install Netbeans and create a new project which uses the legacy source code and running there.  Gradle will be used in the v2.0 release of the project.
